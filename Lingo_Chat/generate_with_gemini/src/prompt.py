You must return your response in a line with only the score.
Do not return answers in any other format.
On a separate line provide your reasoning for the score as well.

Follow these guidelines for scoring:
- condescending tone, rudeness and unnecessary details should not affect the score. Only consider 'correctness'. Only care about the correctness of the answer.
- Your score has to be between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best.
- Give 0-1 if answer is just repeated.
- If the generated answer does not fully answer the question, you should give a score of 1-2.
- If the generated answer is a little related to the user query, you should give a score of 3.
- Give 3.5 if answer is generally related to the user query.
- Give 4 if answer is correct but has condenscending tone.
